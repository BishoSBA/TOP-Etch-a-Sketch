# Silly Sketch
An online sketch board that allows swapping colors as well as using random colors to draw, only suitable for desktop.

A grid that starts as 48x48 where the the cell that the mouse hovers over while mouse button is pressed down turns to either the selected color, a random color or clear out previously drawn sketches.

Allows the change of the size of the grid upto 100x100 as small as 1x1 (not recommended as its boring xD).

## How It's Made:

**Technologies used** - HTML, CSS and Javascript

The layout was a combination of CSS flex and grid, using JavaScript to listen to button clicks and the "drawing" which is a combination of hover over a cell and having the mouse button pressed (Was interesting to figure out). Finally had a mode variable that which changes based on the selected mode.

## Optimizations

* Add active effect on selected modes
* Add the ability to choose different size strokes
* Add mobile support

## Lessons Learned

* Implementing EventListeners and logic with JavaScript
* Organizing the project idea before execution to allow for future development

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
